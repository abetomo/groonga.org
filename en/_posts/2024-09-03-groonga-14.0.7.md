### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Improvements

* [NormalizerNFKC] Added a new option `unify_latin_alphabet_with`.

  This option enables that alphabets with diacritical mark and alphabets without diacritical mark regarded as the same character as below.

  However, this feature focus on only `LATIN (SMALL|CAPITAL) LETTER X WITH XXX`.
  It doesn't support `LATIN (SMALL|CAPITAL) LETTER X` + `COMBINING XXX` characters.

  We can confirm that can get `ngoằn` with `ngoan` in the following example.

  ```
  table_create --name Contents --flags TABLE_HASH_KEY --key_type ShortText
  column_create --table Contents --name content --type ShortText
  load --table Contents
  [
    {"_key":"1", "content":"con đường ngoằn nghoèo"},
  ]

  table_create \
    --name Terms \
    --flags TABLE_PAT_KEY \
    --key_type ShortText \
    --default_tokenizer TokenBigram \
    --normalizer 'NormalizerNFKC150("unify_latin_alphabet_with", true)'
  column_create \
    --table Terms \
    --name index_content \
    --flags COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION \
    --type Contents \
    --source content

  select --table Contents --query content:@ngoan
  [
    [
      0,
      0.0,
      0.0
    ],
    [
      [
        [
          1
        ],
        [
          [
            "_id",
            "UInt32"
          ],
          [
            "_key",
            "ShortText"
          ],
          [
            "content",
            "ShortText"
          ]
        ],
        [
          1,
          "1",
          "con đường ngoằn nghoèo"
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
  ```

  **NOTE:**

    Current normalizers has the following bug.

    The lowercase of `U+0130 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE` must be `U+0069 LATIN SMALL LETTER I`.
    But the current implementation uses `U+0069 LATIN SMALL LETTER I` + `U+0307 COMBINING DOT ABOVE`.

    We will fix the bug from NormalizerNFKC160.

* Added support for [simdjson](https://simdjson.org/).

  Currently, we keeps RapidJSON support but we'll remove RapidJSON support later.

### Fixes

* Fixed a crash bug when log rotate is enabled.

  This bug occurred in the following conditions.

  a. When logging to a file by specification the following options.

    * `--log-path <path>`
    * `--query-log-path <path>`

  b. When log rotate is enabled by specification the following options.

    * `--log-rotate-threshold-size <threshold>`
    * `--query-log-rotate-threshold-size <threshold>`

  c. When process ID log output is enabled by specification the following options.

    * `--log-flags process_id`
