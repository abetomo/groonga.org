## PGroonga (fast full text search module for PostgreSQL) 3.0.2 has been released

[PGroonga](https://pgroonga.github.io/) 3.0.2 has been released! PGroonga makes PostgreSQL fast full text search for all languages.

### Fixes

  * Fixed a bug that PGroonga may crashe when we used ``pgroonga_query_expand()``.

    However, probably, this problem rarely occur.

  * Fixed a bug that ``SELECT`` using PGroonga's index may fail after PostgreSQL crashed while execution ``INSERT``.

    However, probably, this problem rarely occur.

  * Fixed a bug that many compile errors rised when we did not not define ``HAVE_MSGPACK`` in ``src/pgrn-wal.c``.

    This problem only occures when we build PGroonga from sources.

### Thanks

  * OBATA Akio
