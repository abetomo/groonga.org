[PGroonga](https://pgroonga.github.io/) 2.4.5 has been released! PGroonga makes PostgreSQL fast full text search for all languages.

## Highlight

### [[`Crash safe`](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/crash-safe.html)] Fixed a bug that re-index recovery doesn't work when the crash safe module failed recovery using Groonga's WAL.

The crash safe module writes Groonga's WAL (not PostgreSQL's WAL) when PGroonga's indexes are updated. It ensure flushing WAL to storage.

The crash safe module recovers the database automatically. The crash safe module tries recovering from Groonga's WAL.
If it's failed, the crash safe module removes all existing Groonga's database, creates a new Groonga's database and executes `REINDEX`. It rebuild all PGroonga's indexes from data in PostgreSQL.

This problem The crash safe module re-index doesn't work when the crash safe module failed recovery using Groonga's WAL.
