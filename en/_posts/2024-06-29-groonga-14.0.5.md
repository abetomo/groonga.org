### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Fixes

* [[query()](/docs/reference/functions/query.html)] Fixed a bug that the order of evaluation of `'A || query("...", "B C")'` is wrong


  Here is occurrence condition of this problem.

    * We use `OR` search and `query()`.
    * We use `AND` search in `query()`.
    * The order of condition expression is `'A || query("...", "B C")'`.

  So, this problem doesn't occur if we use only `query()` or we don't use `AND` search in `query()`.

  We expect that `{"name": "Alice", "memo": "Groonga user"}` is hit in the following example.
  However, if this problem occurred, the following query had not been hit.

  ```
  table_create Users TABLE_NO_KEY
  column_create Users name COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText
  column_create Users memo COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText

  load --table Users
  [
  {"name": "Alice", "memo": "Groonga user"},
  {"name": "Bob",   "memo": "Rroonga user"}
  ]
  select Users \
    --output_columns 'name, memo, _score' \
    --filter 'memo @ "Groonga" || query("name", "Bob Rroonga")'
  [[0,0.0,0.0],[[[0],[["name","ShortText"],["memo","ShortText"],["_score","Int32"]]]]]
  ```

  After the fix, `{"name": "Alice", "memo": "Groonga user"}` is hit such as the following example.

  ```
  select Users \
    --output_columns 'name, memo, _score' \
    --filter 'memo @ "Groonga" || query("name", "Bob Rroonga")'
  [
    [
      0,
      1719376617.537505,
      0.002481460571289062
    ],
    [
      [
        [
          1
        ],
        [
          [
            "name",
            "ShortText"
          ],
          [
            "memo",
            "ShortText"
          ],
          [
            "_score",
            "Int32"
          ]
        ],
        [
          "Alice",
          "Groonga user",
          1
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
  ```

* [[select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html)] Fixed a bug that a condition that evaluate prefix search in advance such as `--query "A* OR B"` returned wrong search result

  This problem may occur when prefix search evaluate in advance.
  This problem doesn't occur a condition that evaluate prefix search in the end such as `--query A OR B*`.

  If this problem occur, the `Bo` and the `li` of `--query "Bo* OR li"` are evaluated as a prefix search.
  As a result, The following query does not hit. Because `li` is evaluated as a prefix search as mentioned above.

  ```
  table_create Users TABLE_NO_KEY
  column_create Users name COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText

  load --table Users
  [
  ["name"],
  ["Alice"]
  ]

  select Users \
    --match_columns name \
    --query "Bo* OR li"
  [
    [
      0,
      1719377505.628048,
      0.0007376670837402344
    ],
    [
      [
        [
          0
        ],
        [
          [
            "_id",
            "UInt32"
          ],
          [
            "name",
            "ShortText"
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
