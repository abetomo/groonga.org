## PGroonga (fast full text search module for PostgreSQL) 2.4.3 has been released

[PGroonga](https://pgroonga.github.io/) 2.4.3 has been released! PGroonga makes PostgreSQL fast full text search for all languages.

## Highlight

### [`pgroonga_highlight_html` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-highlight-html.html) Added support for the `text[]` type as `target`.

  Normally, we can search column of ``text[]`` with ``&@~``.
  Because ``&@~`` supports ``text[]``.

  However, we had not be able to higlight matched results of ``&@~`` with ``pgroonga_highlight_html()``.
  Because ``pgroonga_highlight_html()`` has not supported ``text[]`` until now.
  This is inconvenience.

  Therefore, we become able to higlight matched results of ``&@~`` with ``pgroonga_highlight_html()`` as below since this release.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE memos (
    contents text[]
  );

  CREATE INDEX pgroonga_contents_index
            ON memos
         USING pgroonga(contents);

  INSERT INTO memos VALUES (ARRAY['Debian', 'Ubuntu']);
  INSERT INTO memos VALUES (ARRAY['CentOS', 'AlmaLinux', 'Rocky Linux']);

  SELECT pgroonga_highlight_html(contents, ARRAY['debian'])
    FROM memos
   WHERE contents &@~ 'debian';

               pgroonga_highlight_html              
  --------------------------------------------------
   {"<span class=\"keyword\">Debian</span>",Ubuntu}
  (1 row)
  ```
