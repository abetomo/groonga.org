## PGroonga (fast full text search module for PostgreSQL) 3.0.1 has been released

[PGroonga](https://pgroonga.github.io/) 3.0.1 has been released! PGroonga makes PostgreSQL fast full text search for all languages.

### Highlight

Here are highlights of PGroonga 3.0.1:

#### Improvements

  * Added a newly function [`pgroonga_wal_status()`](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-wal-status.html).

    This function display a status of applying PGroonga's WAL. The maximum size of PGroonga's WAL is limited by pgroonga.max_wal_size.

    If we execute many modification before PGroonga doesn't apply PGroonga's WAL, not applied PGroonga's WAL may lost. Because PGroonga's WAL is over writed from the head of it when the size of modification over pgroonga.max_wal_size

    We understand the size of applied PGroonga's WAL by this function. Therefore we can prevent lost for not applied PGroonga's WAL.

#### Fixes

  * Fixed a bug that dead lock occures when we execute `UPDATE` or `INSERT` while we execute `REINDEX INDEX ... CONCURRENTLY`.

  * Fixed a bug that if we repeated `REINDEX` and `VACUUM`, PGroonga may return incorrect results and fail `INSERT`.
