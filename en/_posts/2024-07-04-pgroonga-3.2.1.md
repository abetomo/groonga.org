## PGroonga (fast full text search module for PostgreSQL) 3.2.1 has been released

[PGroonga 3.2.1](https://pgroonga.github.io/news) has been released! PGroonga makes PostgreSQL fast full text search for all languages.

### Improvements

  * [[pgroonga_wal_resource_manager module](https://pgroonga.github.io/modules/pgroonga-wal-resource-manager.html)] Added a new module pgroonga_wal_resource_manager

    PGroonga WAL is automatically applied when this module is enabled.

### Fixes

  * [[&@~ operator](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/operators/query-v2.html)] Fixed a crash bug with multiple conditions including blank only query condition.

    An error will occur if any of the multiple conditions have a blank space condition as below.

      ```
      CREATE TABLE memos (
        id integer,
        content text
      );
      INSERT INTO memos VALUES (1, 'PostgreSQL is a RDBMS.');
      INSERT INTO memos VALUES (2, 'Groonga is fast full text search engine.');
      INSERT INTO memos VALUES (3, 'PGroonga is a PostgreSQL extension that uses Groonga.');
      CREATE INDEX grnindex ON memos USING pgroonga (content);
      SELECT id, content
        FROM memos
       WHERE content &@~ pgroonga_condition('PGroonga') AND
             content &@~ pgroonga_condition(' ');
      ```
