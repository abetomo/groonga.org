## PGroonga (fast full text search module for PostgreSQL) 2.4.2 has been released

[PGroonga](https://pgroonga.github.io/) 2.4.2 has been released! PGroonga makes PostgreSQL fast full text search for all languages.

## Highlight

### Added a new module ``pgroonga_standby_maintainer`` for executing ``pgroonga_wal_apply()`` and ``pgroonga_vacuum()`` automatically on a standby database

  The new [``pgroonga_standby_maintainer`` module](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/modules/pgroonga-standby-maintainer.html) since 2.4.2. would be highly recommended for users who need to run [``pgroonga_wal_apply()``](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-wal-apply.html) and [``pgroonga_vacuum()``](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-vacuum.html).

Normally PGroonga's WAL doesn't apply on a standby database, when we use PGroonga with streaming replication.

Therefore, for example, a first "SELECT" on a primary database may become slower after we switch from a standby database. Because it takes time to apply PGroonga's WAL to the primary database.

[The ``pgroonga_wal_applier`` module](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/modules/pgroonga-wal-applier.html) could solve this WAL problem and help users until now. However, pgroonga_standby_maintainer module since 2.4.2. is a new solution and more useful than the ``pgroonga_wal_applier`` module.
Because ``pgroonga_standby_maintainer`` does not only automatically execute the ``pgroonga_vacuum()`` function but also automatically execute the ``pgroonga_wal_apply()`` function on a standby database.

Therefore, with the ``pgroonga_standby_maintainer`` module, the ``pgroonga_wal_applier`` module won't be necessary, and it would not be necessary to execute periodically the ``pgroonga_vacuum()`` function on the standby database.

Please refer to a reference of the ``pgroonga_standby_maintainer`` module about how to the ``pgroonga_standby_maintainer`` module.

### Added the ``pgroonga_snippet_html()`` function, a new argument specifing snippet length dynamically

  The new [the ``pgroonga_snippet_html()`` function](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-snippet-html.html) let us extract around texts of keywords with increased flexibility!

  Normally, the max number of around texts of keywords that pgroonga_snippet_html function can extracts is 200 byte. However, we can adjust this number dynamically with this feature.

  For example, if we want to extruct 50 byte around texts of keywords, we can extruct them as below with this feature.
  Note that We can dynamically specify a length of around texts of keywords with the third argument of the ``pgroonga_snippet_html()`` function.

  ```sql
  SELECT pgroonga_snippet_html(
    'Groonga is a fast and accurate full text search engine based on ' ||
    'inverted index. One of the characteristics of Groonga is that a ' ||
    'newly registered document instantly appears in search results. ' ||
    'Also, Groonga allows updates without read locks. These characteristics ' ||
    'result in superior performance on real-time applications.' ||
    E'\n' ||
    E'\n' ||
    'Groonga is also a column-oriented database management system (DBMS). ' ||
    'Compared with well-known row-oriented systems, such as MySQL and ' ||
    'PostgreSQL, column-oriented systems are more suited for aggregate ' ||
    'queries. Due to this advantage, Groonga can cover weakness of ' ||
    'row-oriented systems.',
    ARRAY['Groonga'],
    50
  );
                                                                                                                    pgroonga_snippet_html
