### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Improvements

* Added support for prefix search without index against vector column.

  We can already prefix search with index against vector column.
  However, we can't prefix search without index against vector column until now.

  We can also prefix search without index against vector column as below since this release.
  `name` column is vector column in the following example.

  We search records start with `al` against `name` column in the following query.
  So, we can confirm that `{"name": ["alice"]}` and `{"name": ["elly", "alice"]}` hit by the following query.

  ```
  table_create Users TABLE_NO_KEY
  column_create Users name COLUMN_VECTOR ShortText
  load --table Users
  [
  {"name": ["alice"]},
  {"name": ["bob"]},
  {"name": ["callum"]},
  {"name": ["elly", "alice"]},
  {"name": ["marshal"]}
  ]
  select Users --query 'name:^al'
  [
    [
      0,
      0.0,
      0.0
    ],
    [
      [
        [
          2
        ],
        [
          [
            "_id",
            "UInt32"
          ],
          [
            "name",
            "ShortText"
          ]
        ],
        [
          1,
          [
            "alice"
          ]
        ],
        [
          4,
          [
            "elly",
            "alice"
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
