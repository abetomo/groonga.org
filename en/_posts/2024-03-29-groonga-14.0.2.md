## Groonga 14.0.2 has been released

[Groonga 14.0.2](/docs/news/14.html#release-14-0-2) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Improvements

  * Reduced a log level of a log when Groonga setting normalizers/tokenizer/token_filters against temporary table.

    For example, the target log of this modification is the following log.

    ```
    DDL:1234567890:set_normalizers NormalizerAuto
    ```

    PGroonga sets normalizers against temporary table on start. So, this log becomes noise. Because this log become output when PGroonga start because of PGroongaâ€™s default log level is `notice`.

    Therefore, we reduce log level to `debug` for the log since this release. Thus, this log does not output when PGroonga start in default.
