## PGroonga (fast full text search module for PostgreSQL) 3.0.3 has been released

[PGroonga](https://pgroonga.github.io/) 3.0.3 has been released! PGroonga makes PostgreSQL fast full text search for all languages.

### Fixes

  * Fixed a bug that PGroonga may have crashed when PGroonga writed PGroonga's WAL.

  * [GH-336](https://github.com/pgroonga/pgroonga/issues/336): Fixed a bug that PGroonga crashed if we specify ``shared_preload_libraries = 'pgroonga'`` in the PostgreSQL's config file. [Reported by askdkc and Rui Chen]

    PGroonga doesn't  crash even if we specify ``shared_preload_libraries = 'pgroonga'`` by this modification.

    However, if we specify ``shared_preload_libraries = 'pgroonga'``, PGroonga doesn't work well.

    For example, ``CREATE INDEX USING pgroonga`` is failed.
    However, probabry, old PGroonga also has not worked well with ``shared_preload_libraries = 'pgroonga'``.

    Because we don't have a timing that initializes Groonga's DB.

    Therefore, we don't specify ``shared_preload_libraries = 'pgroonga'`` in the PostgreSQL's config file.
