### Known Issues

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

* `*<` and `*>` only valid when we use `query()` the right side of filter condition.

  If we specify as below, `*<` and `*>` work as `&&`.

  * `'content @ "Groonga" *< content @ "Mroonga"'`

* Groonga may not return records that should match caused by `GRN_II_CURSOR_SET_MIN_ENABLE`.
