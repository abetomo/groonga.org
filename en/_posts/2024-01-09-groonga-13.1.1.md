How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Improvements

  * Dropped support for the Windows package was built by MinGW32. [GitHub#1654]

  * Added support for index search of `vector_column[N] OPERATOR literal` with `--match_columns` and `--query`.

    We can search with `vector_column[N] OPERATOR literal` in `--filter` since a long time ago.
    We can search only the especially element in vector column with `vector_column[N] OPERATOR literal`.

### Fixes

  * [[Windws](/ja/docs/install/windows.html)] Bundled `groonga-normalizer-mysql` again. [GitHub#1655]

    Groonga 13.1.0 for Windows didn't include `groonga-normalizer-mysql`.
    This problem only occured in Groonga 13.1.0.
