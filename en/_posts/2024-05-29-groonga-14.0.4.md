## Groonga 14.0.4 has been released

[Groonga 14.0.4](/docs/news/14.html#release-14-0-4) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Fixes

* [[query_parallel_or](/docs/reference/functions/query_parallel_or.html)] Fixed a bug that the [`match_escalation_threshold`](/docs/reference/commands/select.html#select-match-escalation-threshold) or `force_match_escalation` options were ignored when using `query_parallel_or()`.

  Before the fix, even when `match_escalation_threshold` was set to disable match escalation, the results still escalated when we use `query_parallel_or()`.
  This problem occurred only `query_parallel_or()`. [`query()`](/docs/reference/functions/query.html) don't occur this problem.

  Generally, we don't disable match escalation. Because we want to get something search results. The number of hits is 0 is the unwelcome result of us. 
  Therefore, this problem has no effect by many users. However, it has effect by user who use stop word as below.

  ```
  plugin_register token_filters/stop_word

  table_create Memos TABLE_NO_KEY
  column_create Memos content COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText

  table_create Terms TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText \
    --default_tokenizer TokenBigram \
    --normalizer NormalizerAuto \
    --token_filters TokenFilterStopWord
  column_create Terms memos_content COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION Memos content
  column_create Terms is_stop_word COLUMN_SCALAR Bool
  load --table Terms
  [
     {"_key": "and", "is_stop_word": true}
  ]

  load --table Memos
  [
    {"content": "Hello"},
    {"content": "Hello and Good-bye"},
    {"content": "Good-bye"}
  ]

  select Memos \
    --filter 'query_parallel_or(["content", "content", "content", "content"], \
              "and", \
              {"options": {"TokenFilterStopWord.enable": true}})' \
    --match_escalation_threshold -1 \
    --sort_keys -_score
  ```

  We don't want to match a keyword that is registered as stopword.
  Therefore, we set `-1` to `match_escalation_threshold` in the above example.

  We expect that Groonga doesn't return records in the above example because of escalation disable and search keyword(`and`) is registered as stopword.
  However, If this problem occur, Groonga returns match record.
  Because if we use `query_parallel_or()`, `match_escalation_threshold` doesn't work.

* Fixed a bug that full-text search againt a reference column of a vector didn't work.

  This problem has occured Groonga v14.0.0 or later.
  This problem has effect if we execute full-text search against a reference column of a vector.

  We expected that Groonga returns `[1, "Linux MySQL"]` and `[2, "MySQL Groonga"]` as below example.
  However, before the fix, Groonga always returned 0 hits as below because of we executed full-text search on a reference column of a vector.

  ```
  table_create bugs TABLE_PAT_KEY UInt32

  table_create tags TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText --default_tokenizer TokenDelimit
  column_create tags name COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText

  column_create bugs tags COLUMN_VECTOR tags

  load --table bugs
  [
    ["_key", "tags"],
    [1, "Linux MySQL"],
    [2, "MySQL Groonga"],
    [3, "Mroonga"]
  ]

  column_create tags bugs_tags_index COLUMN_INDEX bugs tags

  select --table bugs --filter 'tags @ "MySQL"'
  [
    [
      0,
      0.0,
      0.0
    ],
    [
      [
        [
          0
        ],
        [
          [
            "_id",
            "UInt32"
          ],
          [
            "_key",
            "UInt32"
          ],
          [
            "tags",
            "tags"
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
